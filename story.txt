When he saw a falling apple while thinking about the forces of nature. Whatever really happened, Newton realized that some force must be acting on falling objects 
like apples because otherwise they would not start moving from rest.
He thought about this for a long while, and then decided his idea was stupid, and would lead to nothing in the end.
In the end nothing ever came of it

Until he met the improved broccoli. This broccoli was so smart that it convinced Newton that something special must
be happening. The broccoli began guiding Newton to pursue his theory of gravity. The broccoli worked day and night alongside
Newton, creating the most eloquent theorems and equations. To assist, Newton continued to drop apples on his head. All was 
well, until one day Newton decided he had enough...

The broccoli was forcing Newton to drop apples on his head over and over. Day and night, Newton was being pelted by this red
fruit and it was driving him insane. He lashed out at the broccoli and took a bite of him. The broccoli was appalled, but
in the name of science, he continued his research while Newton slowly consumed his entire head of florets.

The end...
